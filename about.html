        <div class="about-content">
          <p>Hi there. I'm an aspiring web / app developer.</p>
          <p>I am one of those guys that has done many things over the years and has picked up multiple skills throughout my journey. Originally starting out as a professional musician and now landing up in the world of Web Development and UX/UI Design. My best skill is the ability to communicate and handle myself well in public, in front of an audience or as a part of a team. I have a great balance of technical ability, logical thinking, problem solving skills and artistic creativity.</p>
          <p>My friends and family say that my best qualities are; my humor, my ability to inspire, motivate and educate others, my willingness to help and my drive to succeed. I have been freelancing my web and graphic design skills for over 10 years and pride myself on delivering results over and above my clients expectations while creating websites their customers love using.</p>
          <p>If you like my work, please visit my Twitter and Facebook page and let your family and friends know about me and the various ways I can help them.</p>
